# Document library structure (draft)

## Libraries / top folders
- 01 Governance (minutes, agendas, policies)
- 02 Campaigns (plans, assets, timelines)
- 03 Comms (drafts, templates, final versions)
- 04 Training (guides, onboarding, FAQs)

## Conventions
- Use clear file names: YYYY-MM-DD_topic_version
- Keep drafts separate from final copies
- Use version history rather than duplicated files
